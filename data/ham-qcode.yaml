From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code).

Selected Q codes were soon adopted by [amateur radio operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_operator). 
In December 1915, the [American Radio Relay League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Radio_Relay_League) began
publication of a magazine titled QST, named after the Q code for "General call
to all stations". In amateur radio, the Q codes were originally used in Morse
code transmissions to shorten lengthy phrases and were followed by a Morse code
question mark (路路--路路) if the phrase was a question.

Q codes are commonly used in voice communications as shorthand nouns, verbs,
and adjectives making up phrases. For example, an amateur radio operator will
complain about QRM (man-made interference), or tell another operator that there
is "QSB on the signal" (fading); "to QSY" is to change your operating
frequency, or to break in on a conversation QSK is often used even on VHF and
UHF frequencies.
