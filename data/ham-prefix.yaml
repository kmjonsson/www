From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_prefix_%28amateur_stations%29)

The [International Telecommunication Union (ITU)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union) allocates [call sign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_sign) [prefixes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_prefix) for [radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_station) and [television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station) stations of all types. [Amateur radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) operators have since 1927 been allocated unique call letters (call sign) to uniquely identify them, as well as locate then within a geographical region of the world - usually a country.

Prefixes are assigned internationally, and a separating numeral plus suffix are added by a national body to produce this unique identifier. These prefixes are agreed upon internationally, and are a form of country code. Each country must only assign call signs to its nationals or operators under its jurisdiction that begin with the characters allocated for use in that country or its territories.

Call signs meant for [amateur radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) follow the ITU's Article 19, specifically 19.68 and 19.69.
